//run all tests on all browsers in headless mode
npx playwright test

//show report
npx playwright show-report

Example Scenario
9 tests: Test1, Test2, ..., Test9
4 workers: Worker1, Worker2, Worker3, Worker4

Execution order:
Round 1: Worker1 runs Test1, Worker2 runs Test2, Worker3 runs Test3, Worker4 runs Test4.

Round 2: As workers finish, they pick the next test:
Worker1 finishes Test1 → starts Test5.
Worker2 finishes Test2 → starts Test6.

And so on, until all tests are completed.
